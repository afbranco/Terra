<h2>Terra customizations</h2>
<p>
The components included in a specific virtual machine define the
interface between the application script and the environment, and thus
determine the abstraction level at which the script programmer will work. 
Terra offers a basic library of components that can be included (or not) in
a specific virtual machine.
As far as possible, these components are parameterized for genericity.
New components can also be included by programmer-savvy users to
create abstractions for new programming patterns, but
the goal of this basic library is to offer a set of components that 
is sufficient for a range of common applications.
This is feasible because most applications for sensor networks are 
variations of a basic monitoring and control pattern.
Because processing resources are limited, these variations typically
involve only basic operations for accessing sensors and actuators and
coordination among motes.
