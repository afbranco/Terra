			<h2>What is Terra IoT System?</h2>
            <p>The Terra system implements a high-level programming environment to support development of IoT/WSN systems.
Basically, Terra System is composed by a small virtual machine that is programmed using a reactive scripting 
language. A Terra developer can customize the VM interfaces to access hardware specific resources. 
Terra was built originally targeting devices based on small micro-controllers and very simple radios, 
but currently we have versions running also in Linux and Android machines.
The <a target="_blank" href={{ page.terra_home_link }}>Terra Site - {{ terra_home_link }}</a> 
presents detailed informations about Terra.

<h2>Current platforms summary</h2>
  <p>Summary of current supported platforms and/or operational system.
The menu <a href="terra-platf-intro.html">Platforms</a> presents detailed informations for each platform implementation.
  </p>
  <p>All platforms implement a minimal support that includes the virtual machine engine, radio communication, 
  and access to a very simples hardware like LEDs or temperature sensors.
   The Dev.Status column indicates some additional or special implementation for specific platform.
