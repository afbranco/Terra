<h1>Terra IoT System</h1>

<h2>What is Terra IoT System?</h2>
<p>The Terra system  implements a high-level programming environment to support development of IoT/WSN systems.
Basically, Terra System is composed by a small virtual machine that is programmed using a reactive scripting 
language. A Terra developer can customize the VM interfaces to access hardware specific resources. 
Terra was built originally targeting devices based on small micro-controllers and very simple radios, 
but actually we have versions running in Linux and Android machines.
The menu <a href="terra-intro.html">Documentation</a> presents detailed informations about Terra.
