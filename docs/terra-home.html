Basically, Terra System is composed by a small virtual machine that is programmed using a reactive scripting

Terra was built originally targeting devices based on small micro-controllers and very simple radios, 
but actually we have versions running in Linux and Android machines.

<h2>Current platforms summary</h2>
  <p>Summary of current supported platforms and/or operational system.
The menu <a href="terra-platf-intro.html">Platforms</a> presents detailed informations for each platform implementation.
  </p>
  <p>All platforms implement a minimal support that includes the virtual machine engine, radio communication, 
  and access to a very simples hardware like LEDs or temperature sensors.
   The Dev.Status column indicates some additional or special implementation for specific platform.
