<h3>Terra System Introduction</h3>
<p>Terra's goal is to facilitate the creation of WSN applications, 
specifically as refers to dealing with event-driven programming and 
with network programming.
The Terra model is based on a virtual machine and combines a reactive scripting language with a set of customized components.
These components may be selected as needed, creating customized virtual machines with abstractions provided by the component interfaces.
A scripting language enforces a programming model that glues components together to create powerful applications in a few lines of code.
This makes them suitable for creating programs that benefit from the pre-defined and pre-installed
set of components and that can be easily sent over the network.
</p>
<p>
Terra uses Céu-T as its scripting language and provides a component-based virtual machine VM-T to be customized for different application domains.
Céu-T implements a variation of the Céu programming language<cite><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2517351.2517360" target="_blank">[SantAnna2013]</a></cite>.
The Terra Virtual machine VM-T, with its customizations, runs on WSN nodes with limited resources.
We built VM-T using the nesC programming language and the TinyOS<cite><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-27139-2_7" target="_blank">[Levis2004]</a></cite> operating system.
Figure 1 presents the three basic elements of Terra.

Terra's guarantees for race freedom and against local starvation and invalid pointers contribute to safer code.
These guarantees came, basically, from the static analysis of the Céu compiler and runtime checks of the VM-T execution.
