<h2> The Terra tools and the pre-built environment </h2>

<h3> 1 - Terra tools</h3>
<p>The Terra development procedure is based on three main tools.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Céu-T compiler that compiles a Céu-T script to the bytecode format of VM-T.</li>
<li>A interative TerraControl Tool to start the script dissemination (load a script) in the network.</li>
<li>A specific customization of VM-T. The VM-T runtime must be pre-loaded in all network nodes. In practice, we can load the runtime on physical nodes or use a simulator.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition we built a graph viewer for the TOSSIM simulator.<p>
<p>Figure 1 presents the interface of TerraTool and the graph viewer for the simulator.</p>

<h3>2 - Pre-built linux environment</h3>

<p>To facilitate the use of Terra we built a Linux environment which includes features that speed up the use of Terra. See the <a href="#tab2-7" data-toggle="tab">Download section</a> to download and install a virtual machine with this enviroment.</p>

<p>This environment includes following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>All necessary software to execute Terra, including TinyOS enviroment, TinyOS Tools, and some other tools.</li>
<li> A text editor (gedit) configured to edit the Céu-T programs. The <code>F5</code> key runs the Céu-T compiler for the currently edited script.</li>
<li> A menu icon to start the <code>Terra Control</code> tool.</li>
<li>Two pre-configured TOSSIM simulators, one for TerraNet and  another for TerraGrp. These pre-configured simulators are prepared to use a grid disposition where the user defines the number of lines and columns. Each radio ranges up to one hop of their neighbors. These simulator are  started from the <code>TOSSIM Net</code> and <code>TOSSIM Grp</code> menu icons.</li>
<li>A menu icon to start the TinyOS SerialForward tool. Use it in the case to connect to a remote node via USB or ethernet</li>
</ul>

<p>Obs: Some menu icons has more options when selected with right button.</p>
