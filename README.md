Terra
=====

Terra System - A tiny virtual Machine for WSN that runs a reactive script language. 

The system has three modules:

1. Terra compiler 'terrac' compiles the Terra script language based on Céu Language to the Terra Virtual Machine bytecode.
2. Terra Virtual Machine 'TerraVM' implements the bytecode Interpreter, the Céu Execution control, the user application disseminations, and specific Terra Flavors Customizations.
3. Terra Control Tool 'TerraControl' is a java interface to control the remote script loading and user message monitoring.
