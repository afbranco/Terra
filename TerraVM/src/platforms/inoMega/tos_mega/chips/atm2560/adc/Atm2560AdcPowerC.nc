/**
 * This component implements a deferred power policy for the ADC.
 * When included, it automatically powers off the ADC when usused for
 * a certain time period (determined by ATM2560_ADC_POWER_OFF_DELAY, by
 * default two seconds). See TEP115 for details on power policies.
 *
 * Note: Due to interplay between the power manager and platform initialization
 * the power policy does not take effect until after the ADC has been used
 * once. This should not present an issue however, since if the ADC components
 * aren't included the ADC is powered off anyway.
